## How I came to this subject


1:1 sessions are for me one of the most valuable moments of being in a leadership position. They not only allow me to follow closely the growth of the people in my team, but my own as well. It is absolutely incredible on how much we can learn from simply hearing other's perspectives. In one of these last sessions with one of my team members, I was asked for guidance on how to improve problem solving skills. And on that moment I realized that, even though problem solving is a core skill on carrers in general, I have never though put much thought into it 

## Approaching Dillemas

I bought a book on Amazon the other day, which was a pretty quick read. The author talked about a situations where we must make a very hard choice between two alternatives: dillemas. To solve a dillema usually seems impossible, and mostly because we try to see dillemas as from a pure black and white perspective: we enforce ourselves to take a side and argue extensively against the other.

This taking-sides approach is flawled by nature due to the simple fact that we are humans and biased by nature, being this bias emotions or personal preferences. How then to avoid this natural instinct and. In such cases, frameworks come in hand for me. Think of frameworks as recipes that help you to achieve something.

## Clearing the path

Well, my first attitude in approaching these scenarios is to take a step back and **stablish a clear goal** that originated this dillema. Having the objective pointed out clearly in front us is fundamental. After all, we can't fix something we don't see, neither reach a place we don't know where it is.

After a clear set of the goal, it is time to take another step back on the dillema. It is by nature consisted of two conflicting options. Start then to **point out the benefits and drawbacks of both**. Having a clear vision of what you win and what you lose when having to choose between two or more things gives you a more rational foundation to make the choice.

With the pros and cons in front of you, you get a good vision of possible wins and losses. Here I also like to think about **discover the problem forces and constraints**. These are the primary the things that will lead you torwards the best option. And here might be helpful to switch the thinking to understand what we lose from one option by choosing its counterpart?



With the goal ahead, the possible paths and their pros and cons stablished, it's time to **try to create a new third option from the benefits of both sides of the dillema**.

> *"Oftentimes, rather than asking what you get out of choosing an option, you get richer answers by asking what you lose by choosing the alternative option."*

I found this sentence to be particuarly true. We tend

## Dealing with bias

The bias itself might, however, not be a bad thing. In some cases to have preferences is completely accetable
